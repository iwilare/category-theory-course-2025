# ITI9200 Category Theory - Exam modalities for Track B

*TLDR.* In this lengthy email I will clarify the exam modalities for Track B and give you a choice to do a relatively straightforward homework that allows you to 1. have to review less things for the final exam, 2. make it so that the oral part is less impactful on your final grade.

If you decide to take the exam by following Track B (computer science), the following thing will happen to give you the final course grade: at the end of the course, we will agree on a date in which to meet physically, and we'll have a chat (say ~1 hour) about the course, where I (Andrea) will ask you questions about the contents of the lectures, and possibly do some small exercises in such a way that I can verify that you understood the concepts of the course and that you know how to practically work with them (like we've done in the lectures).

For your own convenience, you have to option to choose to lower the impact of the final oral exam and study less topics for the oral exam by doing a small homework/exercise sheet before that.

Homework 1 is available on the page of the Track B course (`Homework1.md`), along with all the lecture material:

There are two possible choices for how your final grade will be decided:

- Option 1 (100% oral exam). **This is the default option.** Your grade will be determined 100% by the outcome of the oral exam, as described above.
- Option 2 (50% homework + 50% oral exam):
  1. You send me the homework by the deadline (**28 April 2025, 23:59 EET**). Simply send the homework to my email (andrea.laretto@taltech.ee) or physically hand over a piece of paper that contains your solution.
  2. Your grade will be determined 50% by the outcome of the oral exam, and 50% by the result of the homework.
  3. **The homework has in total 75 points; the homework is considered submitted as long as you score >=25 points.** So if you send something that isn't even worth grading 25 points I will consider it as never submitted. The 25 points threshold is very realistic, you don't have to worry about it; it's just there so that people do not submit silly things. Since 25 is the minimum grade, either you get more than 33% of the grade for the homework or you get nothing at all and you have to fall back to Option 1.
  4. The maximum grade for the homework is achieved when you score 60 out of 75 points, so you don't have to stress too much on getting everything perfect (of course, that helps..!). I **very strongly** encourage however for you to at least try doing all the exercises, and using the leeway for mistakes, so that you can get feedback on all the exercises and the different things they ask of you.
  5. *IMPORTANT FOR YOU.* The oral exam happens *anyways* at the end of the course, although if you do the homework successfully it will definitely last less time (say ~35/40 minutes).
  6. *IMPORTANT FOR YOU.*  If you decide to do the homework, the topics of the oral exam will **not involve** the topics of the homework anymore. *Remember that we're essentially half-way through the course material.*
  7. After the deadline, I will correct everyone's homework, and let you know your homework score along with a brief list of the things you need to improve on the homework if any. In general, I will give you feedback.
  8. After I tell you the grade for homework, you can send me and email or tell me physically that you either **reject or accept** the homework grade. *If you do not say anything it will be considered accepted.* The deadline for this decision is the day of the oral exam.
  9. There will be no second chance for the homework, simply because when you submit it I will give you feedback for it. If you reject it, you will simply have to take the oral exam and follow Option 1. If you have some special request, let's discuss it together.
  10. It would be best if you didn't ask questions on how to do the *exact, specific* exercises of the homework; however, we definitely *can* take a look individually (or in group) on how to do *similar* exercises in the same spirit, just not the exact same homework questions

Some clarifications:

- You do not have to tell us what you choose. No action implies that you will follow Option 1.
- It's okay for you to *compare* your homework with other classmates, as long as it's a learning opportunity for you to see what you did wrong and improve on it. Of course, no straight out copying without understanding.
- If you send in something that does not pass the point threshold I will consider it as it was never submitted.
- It's okay to ask to extend the deadline, but please let me know in advance that you will need some more extra time, let me know either via email or by voice.
- Using any form of aid that involves large language models is absolutely forbidden. (Especially because I've tried and they are just not good on this kind of material.) Please do not make us waste our time reading AI slop, I'd rather make you pass with the lowest grade for free rather than have to waste my time reading and hearing bs. If I even remotely smell that you submitted a homework using one of these tools I will, first, ask you to own up to it and explain your exercises and your thought process for what you submitted, and if that does not convince me I will report you and your submission to TalTech.
- If I sense that you haven't actually understood what you submitted, (e.g., you just copied the answers from somewhere without understanding them) I will have to ask you about it during the oral exam.

Some points on how to write the homework:

- The more it follows the format and approach of the lectures, the better. You don't have to reinvent anything, just convince me that you understood how to work with the definitions of the course.
- Describe precisely which property you had to use to construct the arrows needed in the various exercise sheet, and give it a name according to the conventions that we used in the course, e.g., $\langle f,g \rangle$ for the pairing arrow if you manage to construct $f$ and $g$, $[f,g]$ for copairing arrow, or $\Lambda(f)$ in the context of exponential objects.
- Of course, you can use all the properties that we have seen during the lecture (for example, you're going to need to use the "naturality of products" for some of these exercises) or prove new ones as you write.

IMPORTANT REMINDER:

- Do you feel like you did not understood some lecture/concept?
- Are you unsure whether you understood how to write these exercises?
- Do you think you understood the idea of the material but cannot wrap your mind around the exercises?

All of these problems have the same solution: let's talk about it, we're literally here for this. You are always free (and encouraged!!) to send us exercises, ask any sort of question or doubt about the lecture content, or take a look at parts of lectures or lecture exercises together without any particular commitment or influence on your grades. In particular, if you want to send a solution to one of the exercises shown in the lecture, **even if it's similar to one of the homework (!!)**, we can definitely take a look at it together and I can definitely give you feedback on whether it's correct, or not, and how to solve it.
