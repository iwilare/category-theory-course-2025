# Interesting topics that we have not covered during the course

Here is a non-exhaustive list of topics that I considered to cover in the course that have a relatively strong significance for computer scientists.

- The category of types and relations and its structure (e.g. compact closedness, functions as adjoints)
- Monad algebras (i.e., algebras but $F$ is a monad so you ask that some equations are true)
- Category of monad algebras and its relation to Kleisli categories, category of adjunctions
- Limits: pullbacks, pushouts, equalizers, coequalizers (and why this generalizes products)
- Categorical databases
- Epimorphisms, monomorphisms, topoi
- Kan extensions, presheaves as colimits of representables, presheaves are cartesian closed
- Ends, coends
- 2-categories, string diagrams for 2-categories
- Categorical logic, quantifiers-as-adjoints, indexed categories, fibrations, Grothendieck construction
- Graphical logics, regular logic, first-order bicategories
- Enriched categories, internal categories
- Relative monads, strong monads
