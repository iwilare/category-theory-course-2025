# Topics that we have not covered during the course

- The category of types and relations and its structure (e.g. compact closedness, functions as adjoints)
- Monad algebras (i.e., algebras but $F$ is a monad so you ask that some equations are true)
- Category of monad algebras and its relation to Kleisli categories
- Limits: pullbacks, pushouts, equalizers, coequalizers (and why this generalizes products)
- Monomorphisms, topoi
- Kan extensions, presheaves as colimits of representables, presheaves are cartesian closed
- Ends, coends
- 2-categories, string diagrams for 2-categories
- Indexed categories, fibrations, Grothendieck construction, and their relation to first-order logic
